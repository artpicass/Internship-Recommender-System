# Internship-Recommender-System
**Our little (but exciting) Machine Learning internship project.**
The aim of this project is to learn the various methods that can be used for recommendation systems and do a comparitive study of these methods.

**Dataset used**
 [MovieLens 1M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/)

#### Course structure:
* Week 1: Data Cleaning and Data Visualization
* Week 2: Collaborative Filtering Techiniques (item based, user based)
* Week 3: Content Based Filtering Techiniques
* Week 4: Writing the report and presentation

#### Points to remember while uploading files in our repository:
* Each member should create their own personal folder within this repository where they can upload their Jupyter notebooks, Python files and play around with the dataset
* An additional folder should be created where the members (as a group) decide on the best and most important things they find in their individual notebooks and after reaching a consensus add it to the final Jupyter notebook that will be showcased with the final report.
